# flare_meter
An Arduino Nano 33 IoT based gadget which inteorgates the latest xray flare class information from NOAA GOES Satelite and shows the result visually.

Inspired by a burst of transmission errors picked up in my day job we linked back to a coronal mass ejection I wanted something to show me what the current state of solar flares is.

The data is proviided by NOAA in JSON via the website here: https://services.swpc.noaa.gov/json/
